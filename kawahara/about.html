        designer and developer Mitsugu Takahashi.<br>
        <br>
        I am a Japanese designer who currently works freelance in Tokyo. My value is intersecting logical and emotional concepts.<br>
        I started working 5 years ago and since then I‚Äôve had the opportunity to work with various disciplines such as graphic design, art direction, front-end development, user experience and interface. My works purpose is increase unique expressinons and brands that can make a difference in people‚Äôs lives. What I feel from my five year experience is that brand development and visual making are similar to cooking. So I strive to make designs that pleases the five senses from now on too.<br>
        <br>
        Nothing would make me happier than impressing people with my designs.</p>
